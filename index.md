# About
Hello! My name is Xiangwei, but most people call me David. I'm currently studying computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of
Texas at Austin, with an expected graduation date of May 2021. Besides programming, I also enjoy playing flag football, working out, and playing cello.

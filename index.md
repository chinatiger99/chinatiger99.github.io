# About
Hello! My name is Xiangwei, but most people call me David. I was born in Japan but have spent much of my life in Houston, Texas. I'm currently studying
computer science in the Turing Scholars Honors Program at the University of Texas at Austin, with an expected graduation date of May 2021. Besides programming,
I also enjoy playing sports, working out, and playing cello.

# Coursework
Some classes I'm currently taking include Operating Systems Honors, Quantum Information Science, and Jazz Appreciation. Each class I decide to take has to go
through three questions: Is it required? Is it interesting? Is it fun? I enjoy expanding my worldview while also challenging myself. I'm really interested in
learning about operating systems and how they work, as we use them every day on our phones, laptops, TVs, etc. Quantum computing is shaping up to be the next
big field, and really challenges my traditional worldview by opening my eyes to a new one. I have always liked jazz music, so Jazz Appreciation gave me an
opportunity to learn more about the music I like.

# Experience
I'm currently particiating in the second half of my school's Freshman Research Initative program involving autonomous robotics. The course is overseen by Dr.
Justin Hart and this semester, we're participating in the Toyota Research Institute Challenge. The challenge is to use Toyota's Human Support Robots to grab
LEGO blocks and trash off a bin and to place them in their proper spots. To do this, my teammates and I will use Robot Operating System (ROS) and implemenet
various algorithms/strategies to successfully autonomously complete the challenge.
